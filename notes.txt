- still there are some files whoes number of rows is showed wrongly even by the openpxl so you might have to setup a way by which you open the files 
on the server to recalculate the valid range progmatically...




Questions to ask

the company name allip does not exist 

right now we are removing the the zero if there are three billing increment
values like 1/0/1 it will become 1/1 etc.. is it valid?

does the code names remains same like in same as in the jerasoft or they kept changing like for now we are just fetching the code names from the
jerasoft as the col name is consistent.


==================================

to do

2) (Optional) De-duplicate the “insert rejected email” function

You’ve got both insert_rejected_email and insert_rejected_email_row that do the same thing. You can keep either one; if you want to standardize on

-gpt highlighting issue in the read_comparison_table

- new issue spotted you might have to define a different process for the jerasoft file cleaning.

- also reinstall the requirements file on the server too.

- add two methods like if the data fetched by one excel file read method is too tiny or 
the column are not detected properly then it should fallback to the other one by default. (implemented)

- add one more category in the failed emails which will show failed processed like
in cases where the system failed to process an email due to following reasons (take the details from the 
metadata.json file)

> file cleaning failed
> no data fetched from jerasoft (empty jerasoft file)
> data fetched too short like 7-8 rows so system should show it infact put it as a seperate category what you say. (gotcha)


===================================

issues

some time the header is not getting red by the code if you open the file and expand thoes cols then it works check that stuff.

-there is some calculate_dimension error fix that
-plus jerasoft files are being returned empty check that too (C:\Users\User\OneDrive - Hayo Telecom, Inc\Documents\Work\Rate Sheet Automation\rate-sheet-automation\attachments_new\rates_at_airontel.com_20250911_161838)
-add a new category in the failed emails which also shows the details regarding the files where email process has been incomplete let say preprocessing was not completed etc..




==============================


future considerations

set alerts that will show up on dashboards if there is an issue like too much of 
data or too less or the file from jerasoft is fetched empty which can tell the 
rate team to manaually handle the case.


track the emails that have been processed so the system wont process them again
like by keeping a meta file etc...

see the serach time complexity in both cases.

- in header searching code stop the searchin if the 
code passes first 1000 rows that usually means there
is no matching.

check in the alkaip files the two rates columns are causing the issue.
might be due to your similar word matching God knows
