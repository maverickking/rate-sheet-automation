==================================

New Changes to make

1- Store the following details regarding each file in the meta data:
total_rows, new, increased, decreased, unchanged, closed, backdated_increase, backdated_decrease, billing_increment_changes 
(under key rate_summary(name of that attachment))

see if you can add in here as a value in front of the file name: `` "attachments": [
    "Bankai_Gold_56011_USD_9_.xlsx"
  ],``

2- Fetch the col name (code_name and add that too in the final resultant file)

3- Add the billing_inrement col (old and new) in the resultant file

4- Store the rejected emails in the seperat table
 
5- Take the authorized emails from the db instead of the script (low priority)
