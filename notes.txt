make sure the code can hold multiple files (done)

check how it is comparing the rates 0.13, 0.1300 (done)

add a soft note for backdated increase (done)	

decimal limit to 4.	(done)

show the unchannged as well	(done)




===============
use open ai for the subject validation (kind of hybrid or just free for all)

add try and catch in the main.py file too>

add some fallback mfachanism like if it failed to fetch the file from jerasoft and retry 
and also for the db as well...


===============

also maintain a log of all the files which should show why the email fails?


the code is skipting the already received emails but is it also skipping if it already has the jerasoft files?


like if the process is failed on one directory then it doesn't make sense to repeat ex number of steps on that directory


try to make the footer detection dynamic as well



==================
