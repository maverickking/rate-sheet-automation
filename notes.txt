==================================

New Changes to make

1- Store the following details regarding each file in the meta data:
total_rows, new, increased, decreased, unchanged, closed, backdated_increase, backdated_decrease, billing_increment_changes 
(under key rate_summary(name of that attachment))

see if you can add in here as a value in front of the file name: `` "attachments": [
    "Bankai_Gold_56011_USD_9_.xlsx"
  ],``

2- Fetch the col name (code_name and add that too in the final resultant file)

3- Add the billing_inrement col (old and new) in the resultant file

4- Store the rejected emails in the seperate table
two type of failed emails one failed due to subject or other issues and one failed due to comparision and email not in the verified sender list.
 
5- Take the authorized emails from the db instead of the script (low priority)





Email not in the verified list.
Subject fails
Email has no attachments
Extension not allowed like pdf or other
